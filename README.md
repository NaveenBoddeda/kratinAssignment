In this project, let's build a **Simple Todos** app by applying the React JS concepts .

Developed two components named SimpleTodos and TodoItem.
In SimpleTodos there is an array of initialTodosList with some todo items which has to be done daily by the Sunitha Sharma.initialTodosList is managed in the component with the  state as todosList.
TodoItem component is created to display the single array item in the todosList.
With the help of Unordered list and iterating the todosList using map function, all the array items will be displayed as each item is passed as props to the TodoItem.
If any todo item is completed, after clicking on the task completed button, that respective todo item will be deleted from the todo list with the help of filter function and call back used to get that particular item to be deleted in the list.
If all the todosList is completed, a popup message will come as "You completed all of your daily activities for today".


Further, we can also add new todo to the todoslist by taking input from the user with the help of input element and adding that to the todosList we can achieve that.
